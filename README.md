# tts-discord-bot

Work ongoing.

Regarding the YouTube player

- YouTube limits downloads from servers to stop bots but seems to run fine locally, there may be a workaround but not one that I put enough time in exploring

TODO

- Servers and voice channels should be programatically determined rather than in an env var
- Investigate if some kind of multithreading is necessary if on multiple different servers and being used simultaneously
- Improve TTS to offer more flexibility
